        <h1>Origami</h1>
        <p>Origami is, as you may know, the art of paper folding. 
            Every model shown in this page is made up of one 
            square piece of paper with no cutting or gluing. <br> <br> I first picked up 
            origami when I was in third grade, when my teacher showed the class
            how to make an origami frog. I was very excited to realize that it was 
            pretty easy, and for the next two years or so, I made just about 
            every piece of paper I got my hands on into a frog. The reason 
            I stopped two years later was that my parents got me a simple kit 
            teaching me to make simple origami animals. <br><br>From there, 
            I just kept looking up instructions for new models on the internet.
            If I'm being honest, I can't really remember where I learned a few of the 
            models I'm showing here, but most of them are from the book I've 
            referenced in the <a href="./about_me.html">About Me</a> page. <br><br>
            With that out of the way, I hope you'll enjoy!
