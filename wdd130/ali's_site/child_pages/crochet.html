        <h1>Crochet</h1>
        <p>
            My mom has known how to crochet for as long as I can remember.
            When I was in 5th grade she crocheted me a super long red and yellow 
            striped scarf to be my halloween costume, along with a cloak and a magic wand. (You have three guesses 
            what I was.) A couple years after this, she taught me and some girls in 
            the neighborhood how to crochet a chain (the most basic stich.) For a while, 
            we talked every now and again about her teaching me to really crochet, 
            but neither of us were ever able to find the time. Then Covid hit.
            <br><br>
            My mom was busy working online, but all of a sudden, I was left with nothing but free time.
            After a few weeks of television and practicing my sewing, I came across an 
            old 'How To Crochet' book for beginners. Since my mom croched, I was 
            able to find a hook and, using some old yarn from my room, 
            I quickly taught myself how to do the basic stiches. It only took me three 
            tries to figure out how to make a square with right angles.
            <br><br>
            Within a week I was able to make a heart. After two, I made my first 
            granny square. After a month, I had over a dozen, and a year later, 
            I had enough to make a blanket. So I made a blanket. I still have a lot 
            left over.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, I hope you enjoy!
