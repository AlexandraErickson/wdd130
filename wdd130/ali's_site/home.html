    <h1>Welcome to Alexa's Museum of Random Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Are you looking for a cheap new hobbie? Are you looking for inspiration for 
        one you already have? Are you surfing the internet because you're 
        bored to death? Well, you've come to the right place!
    </p>
    <p>Here, I will display a bunch of random projects that I've made 
        while practicing my hobbies and never thrown away. As a side note, 
        almost none of these designs are my own. I got the origami, crochet, 
        and knitting patterns from various books and websites, which I will 
        reference in the <a class="text_link" href="./child_pages/about_me.html">About Me</a> page. 
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
